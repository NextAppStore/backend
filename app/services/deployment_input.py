"""Validation and normalisation of the deployment wizard's ``userInputVar``.

Two jobs, both defense-in-depth against a hand-crafted POST that the
wizard's own UI would never produce:

* :func:`attach_files_to_user_input` folds the parallel ``files`` field
  into ``userInputVar.terraform`` and validates base64, declared size,
  per-file and per-deployment caps, plus the app author's declared
  ``fileExtensions`` filter.
* :func:`validate_scoped_user_input` enforces that ``varScope =
  team|user`` variables arrive as a map whose keys match the
  deployment's actual team / user roster.

Plus the response-shaping helpers that strip persisted base64 payloads
out of the JSON views (:func:`parse_and_strip_user_input` and friends) —
the dedicated download route is the only path that returns raw bytes.

This module raises ``HTTPException`` on purpose. Its structured 4xx
payloads (``{"reason": "file_too_large", ...}``) are a contract the
wizard reads field by field, so translating them into domain
exceptions and back would only add a lossy hop. It is a request
validation layer, not a domain layer.

    The wizard ships files in a parallel ``files`` field instead of

    apply size / encoding validation in one place. Result is a fresh
    dict with the files folded into ``terraform[var_name]`` — the
    worker doesn't need to know they originally came from a separate
    field.

    Validation:
      * each top-level key in ``files`` becomes one terraform variable
      * each inner-map entry is one ``DeploymentFileUpload`` record
      * ``content_b64`` decodes cleanly (RFC 4648, padding optional)
      * decoded size matches the declared ``size`` (within rounding —
        client may have set it before encoding so we accept ±1)
      * per-file cap and total deployment cap
      * if ``variable_definitions`` are provided and a file variable
        declares ``fileExtensions``, each uploaded filename's suffix
